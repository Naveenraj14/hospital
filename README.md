A real-time tyre health monitoring and management system for mining dump trucks. This application provides a centralized dashboard for managing tyre performance, monitoring sensor data, and scheduling maintenance operations. It enables mining operations and maintenance teams to track critical tyre parameters (pressure, temperature, tilt, vibration, speed, TKPH) in real time, helping to reduce breakdowns, extend tyre life, and optimize operational costs.

The app collects data via IIoT sensors connected to an ESP32 module, transmits it to a backend server built with Spring Boot, and uses machine learning models for predictive analytics, including tyre life estimation, anomaly detection, and safety classification.
